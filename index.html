            <p>The town of Oshtigwanegon, WC is nestled in an isolated corner of the rural Midwest. In a town this small, it doesn't pay to stick out &mdash; so its residents have learned to guard their secrets closely. If you work hard and follow the rules, no one will find out who you've been dating in secret.  Or what you buried under the old oak tree on the full moon. Or what terrible bargain you made to protect your children. Or what you saw in the woods, and what you promised it to let you leave in peace. Or who you <em>really</em> are.</p>
            <p>If you find your place in Oshtigwanegon, you'll feel right at home. But things have been hard in Oshtigwanegon for decades. Once-great factories and business have shuttered their doors, and the population is aging. The Great Recession hit hard in this blue collar town, and everyone knows someone who lost their home. Something's finally going to have to change. Change isn't always for the better, though &mdash; and has a nasty habit of dredging up what you would rather stay buried.</p>

            <p>Ask Again Later is an independent LARP by Head Storyteller Carly Ho and Storytellers Korey Enright, Degen Gottlieb, Isa Janusz, Mark Slattery, and Stephanie Slattery.</p>
            <p>Games will be every two weeks in seasons of three to four games, with a longer "season" break of about two months before the next set of games. We intend to run about three seasons per year. We're committed to running this game for at least a year (about 10-12 games) with the opportunity to renew for further seasons, if there's interest.</p>
            <p>We intend the game to consist of about 20-30 players. Over time, we may allow additional characters, or room for players to rotate in and out, but initially we are capping the playerbase at 30. There may be calls for guest players to come as NPCs from time to time.</p>
            <p>We're currently looking for space on the north side of Chicago and its suburbs. Our preference is for spaces with easy access to public transit and ample parking. We'll inform prospective players when we've settled on a venue.</p>
            <p>Ask Again Later uses a homebrew system of mechanics inspired by the Storyteller System. We'll be releasing more information on our mechanics in the near future in the lead up to character submission.</p>
            <p>While the setting will provide many things for the player characters to struggle against, we have also planned for a significant amount of character vs. character conflict. Stakes for characters in this game can range from being disgraced at the cake-baking competition to death and worse. We expect both social and physical conflict between characters to take place during this chronicle, and view it as important part of our game. Characters can and will die, though the storytellers will do our best to make events that take characters out of play meaningful and satisfying.</p>
            <p>If some conflict does render a character unplayable, players will have the opportunity to come in as a new character. In our setting, though, death does not necessarily mean that a character is unplayable...</p>
